The Formula 1 data analysis problem requires examining a comprehensive F1 dataset to extract insights across multiple racing dimensions. The analysis must identify dominant drivers and constructors through win ratios and podium finishes, evaluate the correlation between career longevity and success metrics, and analyze the relationship between qualifying position and race outcomes. The solution should investigate pit stop strategies by assessing optimal frequency, timing, and efficiency, while analyzing driver rivalries through head-to-head statistics. The analysis will explore hypothetical driver swaps between teams and their potential impact on standings, map driver transitions across teams using network visualizations, and compare team success rates against different opponents with and without circuit considerations. The solution needs to identify driver consistency patterns, analyze lap time efficiency across different circuits, and determine optimal team lineups based on driver performance trends. The analysis extends to making predictions for the 2025 season, identifying struggling teams and driver-specific track performance issues, calculating championship retention probabilities, and analyzing champion age trends across decades. An additional requirement involves predicting future team placements for drivers based on transfer trends. The solution must deliver a predictive machine learning model capable of forecasting outcomes, a data storytelling report containing analysis and visualizations to support insights, and a clear presentation summarizing the findings and predictions. This analytical framework aims to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven predictions from Formula 1 racing data while effectively communicating findings through various analytical approaches.
