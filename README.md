Methodology
Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values (e.g., "\N") and standardized on demand encoding and filtering (subsetting of data)
Features: Driver Consistency (std. dev. of finishes), Team Strength (points + reliability), Track Complexity (overtaking stats).
Visualization: Heatmaps, dominance charts, scatterplots.
Results (Subset)
Performance: (MAE: 2.15, RMSE: 2.98), Scope : XGBoost.
Insights: Reliable teams (e.g., Mercedes: 3% DNF) excel; Verstappen gains on complex tracks (+3 at Spa); 2-3 pit stops (~22s) lift win odds by 15%.
Predictions (Sample): 1. Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. Hamilton (Mercedes), 3. Leclerc (Ferrari), 4. Norris (McLaren), 5. Russell (Mercedes).
Championship: Verstappen (60%), Mercedes (55%) favored.
